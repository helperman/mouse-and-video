Extension for Firefox

Mouse & Video is an extension that helps you seek, change volume, brightness, speed, switch to fullscreen and open the video in a popup window simply by scrolling the mouse wheel on the designated areas in the HTML5 video player. 


<h1>How it works</h1>

The video player will be divided like this:

<img src="img/player.png" />

These areas are hidden, but it shouldn't take long to get used to where each one is. Just scroll up or down on them to control the video playback.

It's also possible to change the video brightness by holding the 'Shift' key while scrolling anywhere within the player.

To be able to switch to fullscreen you have to follow the steps below:
<ul>
  <li>In the address bar type: <b>about:config</b><br>
  <li>Click <b>I accept the risk!</b><br>
  <li>In the Search form, type: <b>full-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only</b> and change it to <b>false</b>
</ul>

Here's how to use the popup feature:

When the video is not in fullscreen mode, scrolling down on the "Fullscreen/Popup" area will open the video in a popup window. When in the popup, scrolling up on that same area will move the video back to it's original position and highlight that page. Scrolling down will also move the video back but you will stay on the tab you're currently browsing.

Shortcut for the popup

Scroll down + up + down quickly should open the popup if there's only one video playing or in case there's more than one video playing a box will appear at the bottom of the page to let you choose which one to open in the popup. This combo won't work in some pages like Firefox's New Tab, options page, etc.
